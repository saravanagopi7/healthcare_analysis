Healthcare Data Analysis and Streamlit Application

Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of healthcare-related data. It involves various data cleaning and preprocessing stages, utilizing MySQL for data storage, Python for data manipulation and analysis, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

Technologies Used
Python: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
MySQL: Used to store cleaned data in structured tables.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive and user-friendly web application to display insights and visualizations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.


Project Workflow
Data Cleaning:

The initial healthcare dataset was imported and cleaned using Python libraries.
Missing values were handled with string value of 'NNot Scheduled, and column names were changed as per the requirement.

MySQL Integration:

Cleaned and processed data was stored in a MySQL database for efficient querying and management.
SQL queries were written to retrieve relevant data for analysis and visualization.

Data Analysis:

Key patterns and trends were identified in the healthcare data, such as Total admissions, seasonal diseases, Doctors' workload and more.

Streamlit Web Application:

A Streamlit web application was created to provide an interactive dashboard for users to explore the data.

The dashboard includes visualizations and tables.
